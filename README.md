# linux-iso-seeder

> **Automated Linux ISO torrent seeder in a single container.**
>
> Helps the open-source community by seeding official ISOs for multiple Linux distributions, with **no manual intervention after deployment**.

## 🚀 **Features**

✅ Automatically fetches the latest torrent files for:

- Ubuntu (All LTS & ESM)
- Debian (latest stable DVD-1)
- Kali Linux (latest installer, netInstaller & everything ISO)

✅ Daily updates with minimal resource usage  
✅ Uses **Transmission-daemon** (lightweight torrent client)  
✅ **Logs and metrics** for transparency and future monitoring  
✅ Automatically cleans up old torrents and their data  
✅ Designed as a **single-container, deploy-and-forget solution**

## 📦 **Volumes**

| Container Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/config` | Transmission configuration files |
| `/downloads` | Downloaded ISO files (seeding storage) |
| `/watch` | Torrent watch folder |
| `/logs` | Persistent logs for fetch script runs |

---

## 📝 **Usage Example**

```bash
docker build -t linux-iso-seeder .

docker run -d \
  -v /path/to/config:/config \
  -v /path/to/downloads:/downloads \
  -v /path/to/watch:/watch \
  -v /path/to/logs:/logs \
  -p 9091:9091 \
  linux-iso-seeder
```

## 🔍 **How it works**

1. **On container startup:**
   - Updates packages and Transmission to the latest version.
   - Starts `fetch_torrents.py` in the background.

2. **Daily:**
   - Fetches torrent files for configured distros.
   - Downloads them to `/watch` for Transmission to seed.
   - Logs results and disk usage to `/logs/fetch_torrents.log`.

3. **Transmission-daemon runs continuously**, seeding all loaded torrents.
